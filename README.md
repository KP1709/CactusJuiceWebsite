# Cactus Juice Website

## ‚å®Ô∏è Technology + Asset Stack 
HTML / SASS + SCSS / Vanilla Javascript / Vite / npm / Node.js / Netlify / Spline / Microsoft Designer

## üçº Introduction
Inspired by Avatar: The Last Airbender, I created a product site advertising cactus juice as shown in the series. I wanted to have the opportunity to practice my skills using Vanilla Javascript. In addition, I wanted to improve my SASS/SCSS skills. Overtime as the project grew, I explored different areas such as implementing animations using the Intersection Observer API and creating a 3D model using Spline. 

(Although I don't have a background in 3D modelling, it's something I would like to continue learning.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Simple scroll animations implemented when moving to different sections
- Responsive design - works on mobile/tablet and desktop
- Mixture of CSS flexbox and CSS grid for element organisation and layouts
- Quantity element with conditions added to prevent breaking it
    - Quantity minimum value is 1
    - If there is no value entered and the user presses either (+ / -) button, the value defaults to 1.
